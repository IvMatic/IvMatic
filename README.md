## Hi there 👋

# Hi, I'm Ivan 👋

I'm interested in **AI interpretability** and **AI safety**.

### What I'm working on
- 🔍 Reproducing interpretability papers with open models
- 🧪 Small experiments on robustness & safety
- 📚 Notes on interpretability & alignment literature

### Transformer Interpretability Projects

- 🧬 [Features in Transformer Models](https://github.com/yourname/transformer-features-interpretability)
- 🔌 [Circuits in Transformers](https://github.com/yourname/transformer-circuits)
- 🌍 [Universality in Transformer Circuits](https://github.com/yourname/transformer-universality)
